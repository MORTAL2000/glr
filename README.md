This is a simple proof-of-concept of an OpenGL 2D rasterizer for web engines, based on aggressive batching of drawing operations. Its purpose is to provide the minimum implementation required to explore the idea, allow meaningful comparison with existing rasterizers on specific use-cases, and possibly fail fast.
